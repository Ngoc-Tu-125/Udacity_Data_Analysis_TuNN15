 - The populor start hours are 7AM or 17PM
 - Althought the number of Subscribes larger than the Customer but the Duration time of the Customer is larger
 - Although a greater percentage of male members, females tend to ride longer than men
 - It's not much of a surprise that the duration time of weekends is more than weekdays
 - The starting times for weekday trips are roughly the same. And the same goes for 2 weekends
 - We can see that the average weekly Customer trip time is much higher Subscriber. While the average daily Subscriber is around 10. The Customer's fluctuates with a large amplitude of 20-30 minutes on average per day
